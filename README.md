## Welcome to the dbt-training

As we continue our data journey with the modern data stack, this repository is intended to be a collaborative space for UCSC staff to learn and gain familiarity with dbt and Snowflake. Therefore, it is **important** to understand that this repository and content are for training purposes only, and no UCSC data will be used during these classes.  

dbt Labs offers free online high-quality training that provides a hands-on experience where participants model data from a fictional retail store using the dbt Cloud product. It's a great way to get experience with dbt and understand the product capabilities.

## FAQ

#### Why GitHub and not UCSC managed Bitbucket?
- dbt Cloud, the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that is used through out the class integrates natively with GitHub. Should we adopt dbt Cloud, this functionality will likely migrate to Bitbucket.
