## Welcome to the dbt-training

As we continue our data journey with the modern data stack, this repository is intended to be a collaborative space for UCSC staff to learn and gain familiarity with dbt and Snowflake. Therefore, it is **important** to understand that this repository and content are for training purposes only, and no UCSC data will be used during these classes.  

dbt Labs offers free online high-quality training that provides a hands-on experience where participants model data from a fictional retail store using the dbt Cloud product. It's a great way to get experience with dbt and understand the products capabilities.

## Course Assumptions

- Knowledge of SQL:You have written queries that used JOIN or CASE WHEN statements.
- Basic Data Warehouse Knowledge: You have experience querying in a relational database.
- Strongly encouraged: Basic Understanding of Git.


## Important Changes during setup!
The course instructs you to create your own personal GitHub repository and a trial Snowflake account. The changes outlined below will allow you to access the UCSC Snowflake account and work from a shared GitHub repository. 

The dbt Fundamentals course begins with a series of video introductions.  During the third series under "Setup dbt Cloud" there is a section called "Connect to your warehouse and repository"  You will want to **pause at this point** and connect with a project team member that will be able to provide the Snowflake account information as well as authentication information.

## FAQ

#### Why GitHub and not UCSC managed Bitbucket?
- dbt Cloud, the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that is used through out the class integrates natively with GitHub. Should we adopt dbt Cloud, this functionality will likely migrate to Bitbucket.
