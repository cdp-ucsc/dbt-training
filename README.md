## Welcome to the dbt-training!

As we continue on our data journey with the modern data stack, this repository is intended to be a collaborative space for UCSC staff to learn and gain familiarity with dbt and Snowflake.  It is **important** to understand that this repository and content are for training purposes only and no UCSC data will be used during this course.

## FAQ

#### Why GitHub and not UCSC managed Bitbucket?
- dbt Cloud, the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that is used through out the class integrates natively with GitHub. Should we adopt dbt Cloud, this functionality will likely migrate to Bitbucket.
