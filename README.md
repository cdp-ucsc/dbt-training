## Welcome to the dbt-training

This repository is intended to be a collaborative space for UCSC staff to learn and gain familiarity with dbt and Snowflake. Therefore, it is **important** to understand that this repository and content are for training purposes only, and no UCSC data will be used during these classes.  

dbt Labs offers free online high-quality training that provides a hands-on experience where participants model data from a fictional retail store using the dbt Cloud product. It's a great way to get experience with dbt and understand the products capabilities.

## Course Assumptions

- Knowledge of SQL:You have written queries that used JOIN or CASE WHEN statements.
- Basic Data Warehouse Knowledge: You have experience querying in a relational database.
- Strongly encouraged: Basic Understanding of Git.


## Accounts you will need to create
- [GitHub Setup](https://cdp-ucsc.github.io/doc/docs/program_overview/practitioner/onboarding/github_setup_instructions)
- [Enroll in Fundamentals - dbt-training account](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/fundamentals) ( see additional info below)


Technically speaking you will have two dbt-cloud accounts. The first one that can create on your own from the link above when enrolling in the course; think of this as a view only dbt-training account. 

The second, will be your UCSC managed account that you will use to perform the actions described in the training materials, and any future work with CDP.  You will recieve an email invite for this; typically during an onboarding session.   While taking the class it will be necessary to use two browsers such as, **Firefox** for view only account and **Chrome** for performing the labs with your UCSC account.


## Course Modifications

The course instructs you to create your own personal GitHub repository and a trial Snowflake account. The changes outlined below will allow you to access the UCSC Snowflake account, the UCSC dbt-cloud platform and work from the UCSC CDP GitHub Organization. 


### Section 3 - Set up dbt Cloud
We've set up the infrastructure for you, but this is all good information to understand, please treat this section as important but information only as no action is required on your part.

### Section 8 - Deployment

Again, and important topic and worth understanding, but since we are using single-sign-on in dbt-cloud, you can also treat this section as information only.
